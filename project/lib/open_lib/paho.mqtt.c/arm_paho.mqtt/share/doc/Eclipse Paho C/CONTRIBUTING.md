# Contributing to Paho

Thanks for your interest in this project!

You can contribute bugfixes and new features by sending pull requests through GitHub.

## Legal

In order for your contribution to be accepted, it must comply with the Eclipse Foundation IP policy.

Please read the [Eclipse Foundation policy on accepting contributions via Git](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git).

1. Sign the [Eclipse ECA](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
  1. Register for an Eclipse Foundation User ID. You can register [here](https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/createaccount.php).
  2. Log into the [Eclipse projects forge](https://www.eclipse.org/contribute/cla), and click on 'Eclipse Contributor Agreement'.
2. Go to your [account settings](https://dev.eclipse.org/site_login/myaccount.php#open_tab_accountsettings) and add your GitHub username to your account.
3. Make sure that you _sign-off_ your Git commits in the following format:
  ``` Signed-off-by: Alex Smith <alexsmith@nowhere.com> ``` This is usually at the bottom of the commit message. You can automate this by adding the '-s' flag when you make the commits. e.g.   ```git commit -s -m "Adding a cool feature"```
4. Ensure that the email address that you make your commits with is the same one you used to sign up to the Eclipse Foundation website with.

## Contributing a change

1. [Fork the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c/fork)
2. Clone the forked repository onto your computer: ``` git clone https://github.com/<your username>/paho.mqtt.c.git ```
3. Create a new branch from the latest ```develop``` branch with ```git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME origin/develop```
4. Make your changes
5. If developing a new feature, make sure to include JUnit tests.
6. Ensure that all new and existing tests pass.
7. Commit the changes into the branch: ``` git commit -s ``` Make sure that your commit message is meaningful and describes your changes correctly.
8. If you have a lot of commits for the change, squash them into a single / few commits.
9. Push the changes in your branch to your forked repository.
10. Finally, go to [https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c) and create a pull request from your "YOUR_BRANCH_NAME" branch to the ```develop``` one to request review and merge of the commits in your pushed branch.


What happens next depends on the content of the patch. If it is 100% authored
by the contributor and is less than 1000 lines (and meets the needs of the
project), then it can be pulled into the main repository. If not, more steps
are required. These are detailed in the
[legal process poster](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/EclipseLegalProcessPoster.pdf).
